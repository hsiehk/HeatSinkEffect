# Thermal Conductivity Mapping

The purpose of the repo was to track temperature rise of a metal heater block with respect to time, in addition to calculating the natural heat transfer convection coefficients based on the surface of the heater block when air is circulating over the top and bottom faces and when the air is circulating over the top face only. To do the experiment, two heater blocks were used with one having a heat sink attached to it and a current was applied through the heater block to increase the temperature of both blocks. After reaching steady state conditions, results indicate that the heater block with the heat sink had a overall lower steady state temperature than the block without the heat sink. Possible explanations for this result may be due to the heat sink being able to transfer the heat from the heater block into the air more efficiently, dissipating the heat from the block resulting in an overall lower temperature. However, it is important to take into account the fact that multiple sources of error could have also contributed to the difference in temperature, such as the age of equipment, set up of the experiment which allowed for convection to occur and human error, to mention a few. Overall though, it can be concluded that the heat sink yielded an overall lower steady state temperature and that it is an effective tool to mitigate heat generation.
